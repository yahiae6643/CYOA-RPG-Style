You encounter a chest full of gold and silver, and you look in awe as the coins gleam. There is a gold coin on the floor and you pick it up. You take a bite of the coin and it leaves a dent. You are tempted to go to the chest but the chest is next to the exit of the dungeon. **Do you choose the chest or leave the dungeon?**
